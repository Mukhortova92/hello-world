        <i>Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
            To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
            Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo</i>

        <h5>Verse 1</h5>
        <i>His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
            There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
            He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
            To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
            What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
            He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
            He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
            The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
            Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
            There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
            Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
            His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
            He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
            When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
            Back to the lab again yo, this old rap shit, he
            Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and</i>

        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <i>You better lose yourself in the music
            The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
            You better lose yourself in the music
            The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
            You better…</i>
